                55% of Black adults report that theyâ€™ve had at least one negative experience 
                with health care providers in the past, such as feeling they had to speak up 
                to get the proper care or that the pain they were experiencing was not being 
                <strong>taken seriously</strong>.<sup>1</sup>

               to demand preventive health care services.<sup>2</sup>
